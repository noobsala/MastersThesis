A framework for up-scaling DEM simulations is presented in this thesis. Up-scaling is achieved by matching homogenized stress-strain curves from REV-scale DEM simulations to single element continuum models using PSO and LMA optimization algorithms. A Drucker-Prager plasticity model with ductile damage is implemented in the CDM model to empirically capture the effect of the degradation (damage) of the NFR as deformation takes place.

\section{Conclusions}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------

In this thesis, a multi-scale up-scaling framework is developed to address the computational demands of simulating microscale phenomenon in a macroscale domain in the context of NFR. The specified research objectives set out in Chapter 1 have been met and detailed below:

\subsection*{Up-Scaling Framework}

The \textbf{M}odular aut\textbf{O}mated \textbf{U}p-\textbf{S}caling softwar\textbf{E} (MOUSE) for DEM simulations was created and written in Python\textsuperscript{TM} to provide an implementation of the up-scaling framework presented in the previous chapter using in house and third-party software modules. The software itself aims to provide a platform through which the four software elements of the up-scaling framework (DEM, homogenization, parameter estimation, and macroscale model) can communicate with each other. The communication is facilitated by MOUSE through modules which wrap the third party software in such a way that the I/O routines to and from the modules are performed in a consistent capcity regardless of the third party software being used. 

\subsection*{Deformable DEM Homogenization}

Homogenization algorithms are developed for homogenizing DEM simulations with deformable bodies to assess the spatially averaged stress-strain behaviour of the REV from the microscale displacements, strains, and stresses. In this homogenization process, the resultant inter-block contact forces and block displacement from the DEM simulations are converted to average stresses and strains. For the homogenization procedure to yield meaningful results, it should be applied to a REV. The exact size of the REV depends on the geometry and mechanical properties of the DEM model. A method for automatically assessing a suitable REV is presented. 

\subsection*{Parameterization Methodology}

The Drucker-Prager model with ductile damage is shown to be a reasonable CDM model approach to represent NFR in a continuum context, including effects of pressure dependent yield and the triaxiality based damage initiation criterion. Compared to a full DEM simulation, the CDM model shows a good fit pre-damage, but is unable to emulate the subtle post-yield oscillations arising from non-continuous yielding in the NFR.

\subsection*{Computational Efficiency Increase}

Most importantly, with this up-scaling framework, very comparable results ($<5\%$ error) to full DEM solutions can be obtained with the CDM method but with two to three orders of magnitude less computational time.

\section{Future Considerations}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------

The implementation of this up-scaling framework is presented in an illustrative context only. The limitations of this implimentation are known, and such limitations are addressed below with suggestions for future improvement. 

The main limitation of the presented up-scaling implementation is the macroscale constitutive model module. In the current ABAQUS\textsuperscript{TM} module, the constitutive models consider only isotropic elasto-plastic and damage behaviour. In addition, the model does not consider the effects of pore pressure in the rock mass or fluid flow in any capaicty. Though the isotropic assumtions for the elasto-plastic constitutive relationships are likely sufficiently accurate, future implementations of the macroscale constitutive model should consider anisotropic damage behaviour, as anisotropic implementations are found to be completely insufficient. In the case of the Drucker-Prager model with ductile damage, the exponential Johnson-Cook triaxiality based damage initiation criterion provides an excelent fit for monotonic loading, but does not model cyclic loading well. Here, it would be ideal for the cyclic loading capacity of the damage plasticity model for quasi-brittle materials to be incorporated as well. Ultimately, the available damage material subroutines in ABAQUS\textsuperscript{TM} are insufficient for the key physical characteristics in the system to be captured. As such, a custom anisotropic damage implementation is reccomended for the macroscale constitutive model.

Retrospectively, the functional assuption of the hardening curve is overly complex. Though it is often necessary to model the softening of the material in the plasticity model, with CDM the damage can implicitly model the softening behaviour. Here, it is observed that for the Barcelona model used for the hardening/softening curve, only the hardening portion of the curve is ever used. As such, for future implementations of the plasticity hardening functions, a perhaps simpler exponential function could be applied which would also have the benifit of decreasing the number of parametes than need to be estimated leading to more consistent solutions and faster convergence of the optimization algorithms. 

Furthermore, it is speculated by the author that portions of the parameterization methodology could be modified to yeild more consistent solutions. In the parameterization formulations presented in this thesis, too much emphasis was placed on creating physically meaningful parameters rather than numerically consistent parameters. This inconsistency is the case with certain paired parameters if one of the parameters is highly sensitive. For example, In the case of the Barcelona hardening curve, since only the hardening portion of the curve is being used, having the curve specified by a coordinate pair of parameters at the peak can provide an almost identical curve for two different parameter pairs. Instead it may be more appropriate for the curve to be specified in terms of the curvature, which leads to a more consistent solution.

Additionally, effectively searching a 11+ dimensional parameter space is computationally expensive. By dividing the problem and exploiting features of the curves and constitutive models, it may be possible to increase the convergence rate and effectively get a better, faster solution. Instead of searching the entire parameter space, it is possible to split the parameters into groups (e.g. pre-damage and post damage). Here, the damage parameters don't actually affect the plasticity calculations untill damage is initiated. As such, the plasticity parameters can be estimated using the pre-damage curve and the damage parameters can subsequently be estimated using the post-damage curve.

Performing a more rigorous examination of other available optimization routines and associated optimization parameters would be another way to potentially reduce the computational cost and increase the accuracy of the parameter estimation process. PSO and LMA were used in this research, but Dynamically Dimensioned Search (DDS), 
Real-Coded Genetic Algorithm (RGA) and Simulated Annealing (SA) were also briefly investigated. As previously stated, rigorously assessing the most effective algorithm was not a priority of this research, but the PSO + LMA combination was chosen for it's simplicity and effectiveness. The other algorithms, if properly applied may provide a faster and more accurate solution.
	
For this up-scaling methodology to be truly usefull, the transition to hydro-mechanically coupled DEM simulations is required. This increased complexity adds additional computational demands on the system, which may show additional efficiency increases when up-scaled to a macroscale constitutive model. Additionally, 3D DEM simulations are required to capture accurate physical responses of these comlex systems. Thus, modifying the DEM module to perform 3D hydro-mechanically coupled simulations would make this implementation far more usefull.  

With 3D hydro-mechanically coupled DEM simulations come the neccessary modification of the homogenization module. Here, the homogenization module should be modified to assess the 3D stress and strain tensors as well as assessing the homogenized fluid properties such as pore pressure and flow velocity vectors. 

Ultimately, a not-insubstantial amount of work is required to make this up-scaling implementation viable for real world applications. Once this is state is attained, the extensions of this work are virtually limitless.
